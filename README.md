🫀 AI-Powered Heart Health Monitoring System

An end-to-end machine learning–based web application that predicts heart disease risk using clinical health parameters. The system provides risk classification, precautionary medical guidance, and generates downloadable PDF reports through an interactive interface.

This project demonstrates the full ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model usage to deployment with a user-friendly UI.
